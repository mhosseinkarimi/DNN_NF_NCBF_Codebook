## üìñ Abstract

This project introduces a **Deep Neural Network (DNN) Codebook** approach to mitigate **multi-user interference (MUI)** in **extremely large MIMO (XL-MIMO)** systems operating in the **near-field**.  

By partitioning the Fresnel region and training lightweight fully connected DNNs on LCMV-generated beamforming weights, the framework achieves **nulling control beam focusing (NCBF)** efficiently.  

Key results show **phase error ‚âà 0.085 radians**, **magnitude error ‚âà 0.52 dB**, and **interference suppression > 31.6 dB**, validated in **Ansys HFSS full-wave simulations**.

## üß© Contributions

- **Scalable Codebook Design:** A library of compact DNNs specialized for subsections of the Fresnel region.  
- **Correlation-Based Sampling:** Efficient partitioning based on channel correlation instead of uniform sampling.  
- **Dual-Estimator Networks:** Separate phase and magnitude predictors improve stability and accuracy.  
- **Full-Wave Validation:** Performance confirmed using Ansys HFSS with realistic antenna arrays.  
- **High Accuracy:** Interference suppression within **2 dB of LCMV** while drastically reducing complexity.

*Fig. 1. Partitioning of the near-field region using correlation-based sampling.*  

‚û°Ô∏è The Fresnel region is divided into **75 subsections**, each assigned two DNNs (phase & magnitude). This ensures efficiency across distances and angles.

‚û°Ô∏è User coordinates are processed, and the corresponding DNN model predicts beamforming weights. Compact per-region models reduce complexity while maintaining accuracy.

‚û°Ô∏è **Scenario 1 (non-collinear users):** DNN results nearly overlap with LCMV, with nulls > 31.6 dB.  
‚û°Ô∏è **Scenario 2 (collinear users):** DNN achieves strong suppression (32‚Äì36 dB), within 2 dB of LCMV.
